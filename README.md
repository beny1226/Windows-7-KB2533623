# Windows-7-KB2533623
For that pesky kernel32.dll error. x64 and x86 versions included for a 32 bit or 64 bit OS.

On October 3rd, 2020, I was installing Windows 7 on an older laptop that I've had for years. Windows 10 runs like absolute garbage and Linux just isn't for me. (Yes, I know that Windows 7 isn't getting security updates anymore.)

Spent HOURS trying to fix the kernel32.dll error to install WiFi drivers on the dang thing. I wouldn't wish what I experienced on anyone, not even on my worst enemy.

I saw other github threads from as little as a month ago talking about this, and hopefully people find my repository so this problem can be laid to rest.



If you're wondering how I found these files:
  I found the dead link for both x86 and x64 versions of this update data, and put it in the wayback machine. By some holy force, someone recorded that website and I could download the files. Github just makes everything easier, so I thought the right thing to do would be to post them here.
